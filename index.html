								<h3>Pet Sitting</h3>
								<p>
									Going away? I’m happy to care for your pets and your home while
									you’re gone. Each stay will be based around your pet’s routines and
									personalities. I will take care of feeding, walks, playtime, and any
									litter boxes all while providing them with lots of love and
									attention. Your home stays safe and cozy and your pets happy and
									cared for so you can relax and enjoy your time away. Also, you can
									expect video and picture updates daily to ease any worries or to
									just get a daily fill of their cuteness.

								<h3>Drop-in Visits</h3>
								<p>
									Drop in visits offer attentive, personalized care to keep you pet
									happy and comfortable while you’re away. Each visit can be tailored
									to your pet’s needs. The visit could include feeding, fresh water,
									potty breaks, litter box cleaning, playtime, medications if needed
									or just a wellness check. I promise to follow your pet’s routine and
									provide plenty of affection and enrichment, all in the comfort of
									their own home. You’ll receive updates after every visit, giving you
									the peace of mind that your pet is safe, happy, loved and well cared
									for.
